# Triplet loss modifications

This repository is dedicated for my term paper after the 3rd year on the topic "Triplet loss modifications for deep metric learning tasks".

All code of experiments can be found here. This code uses Python language, [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) and [Open Metric Learning](https://github.com/OML-Team/open-metric-learning) libraries with all their dependecies. All requirements can be seen in `requirements.txt`.
